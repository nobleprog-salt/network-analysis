## ICMP ANALYSIS EXERCISES

**icmp-dest-unreachable.pcapng**
  - What could be the reason why this ICMP ping is unsuccessful?
  - Who responds to the pings and what does the host indicate?

**icmp-payload.pcapng**
  - What is in the payload of these ICMP packets?
  - Why would this type of traffic be a security concern?

**icmp-ping-2signatures.pcapng**
  - What is in the payload of these ICMP packets?
  - How would you create a display filter to show only ICMP Echo packets that contain one or the other payload?

**icmp-traceroute2011.pcapng**
  - Did this traceroute reach the target host?
  - Were all the routers along the path discovered?
  - How many hops away is the target?

**icmp-traceroute-normal.pcapng**
  - This ICMP-based traceroute operation shows the dependency on the ICMP Time to Live Exceeded/Time to Live Exceeded in Transit response that is used to locate routers along a path.
  - Were all the routers along the path discovered?
