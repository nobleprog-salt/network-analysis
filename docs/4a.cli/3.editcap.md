## Edit Tracefiles with Editcap

Split a given trace file. Each new tracefile should have a maximum of 2000 packets.
```sh
$> editcap -c 2000 /tmp/test.pcapng /tmp/split-test.pcapng
```

Make a new version of a given tracefile and subtract 0.2 seconds from all timestamps in a new tracefile
```sh
$> editcap -t -0.2 test.pcap newtime-test.pcapng
```

Make a new version of a given tracefile and add 5 seconds from all timestamps in a new tracefile
```sh
$> editcap -t +5 ./tracefiles/cli/serverside-ftp.pcapng newtime-serverside.pcapng
```
