## Merge Tracefiles with Mergecap

Merge two files and create new file. Merge is based on timestamps
```sh
$> mergecap -w newtrace.pcapng /tmp/split-test_00000_20171121061958.pcapng /tmp/split-test_00001_20171121062030.pcapng
```

Combine five tracefiles beginning with split* to a new file called join.pcapng. Files are merged based on frame timestamps.
```sh
$> mergecap -w join.pcapng /tmp/split*
```

Concatenate two files and create new file. Timestamps are not considered
```sh
$> mergecap -a -w newtrace.pcapng /tmp/split-test_00000_20171121061958.pcapng /tmp/split-test_00004_20171121062042.pcapng
```
