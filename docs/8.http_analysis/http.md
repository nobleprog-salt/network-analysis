##HTTP/HTTPS display filters

```sh
http.request.method=="GET" or http.request.method=="POST"
#HTTP GET or POST requests

http.response.code > 399
#HTTP 4xx or 5xx (client or server errors)

http contains "IfModified-Since"
#Determine if a client has cached a page already

http.host=="www.wireshark.org"
#Target host is www.wireshark.org

http.user_agent contains "Firefox"
#HTTP client is using Firefox browser

http.referer contains "wireshark.org"
#HTTP client has reached the current location from a link on wireshark.org

tcp.port==443
#HTTPS

ssl
#Secure Socket Layer (secure browsing session) - consider using tcp.port==443

ssl.record.content_type==22
#TLSv1 handshake

ssl.handshake.type==1
#TLSv1 Client Hello in handshake

ssl.handshake.type==16
#TLSv1 Client Key exchange
```


**Request Header/Modifier**
The request-header fields allow the client to pass additional information about the request, and about the client itself, to the server. These fields act as request modifiers, with semantics equivalent to the parameters on a programming language method invocation.
